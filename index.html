        <p>Are you thinking about getting into coding? Bug-eyed by the number of programming languages offered?
          Overwhelmed by resources like <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/">Reddit</a>
          telling you which language to pursue?</p>
          <p><strong>Don't Worry</strong>. This is what we are here for. While we encourage you not to get hung up on deciding which language to learn (we believe every aspiring coder 
          should rather spend their energy understanding the basics), we are all too familiar with your obsession of finding the language that best fits your skillset and personality.</p>
          <p>Take our short survey to help point you in the right direction. Our time-tested algorithim has guided some of the most distinguished individuals in modern-day programming: 
          Ada Lovelace, Guido Van Rossum, and Collin Chapman to name just a few. Follow in their footsteps and get started now.</p>
