# Programming Language Suggester

#### Epicodus Intro To Programming - JavaScript and jQuery

## By Collin Chapman

### Description

I have created an application for people interested in coding to decide which three languages they should consider. 

### Setup 

Create the initial index.html page in HTML that will gather input from the user and ultimately use branching to return suggested languages. The user will answer multiple questions to determine what language and environment best suits them. The site will also be styled using CSS.


### Technologies Used

CSS
